Even after the action, not a single word was exchanged. However, just as you are still contemplating when and where to continue negotiations, the girl sends an invitation for a private conversation through the previous contact method.",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE1_TEXT_3":"With a hint of helplessness, the girl says.",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE2_TEXT_0":"Although in this post-collapse era, the living conditions and interior environments of most ship are modified or designed to meet only the most basic living needs, you finally found a room suitable for both tea-drinking and stargazing as the venue for the negotiation with the girl.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE2_TEXT_1":"Entering the room and taking a seat, the girl appears almost identical to what you previously saw on the planet. The only difference is perhaps the elegant dress that seems out of place in space or on a ship— a dress with traces of dust on the hem and droplets on the sleeves. Though clearly not from combat, these meager 'real' traces do not visibly alter the girl's overall fantastical charm. Instead, they accentuate the mystery and traditional aura she exuded during your first encounter.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE2_TEXT_2":"After once again marveling at the girl's mysterious charm, you prepare to get down to business. But just as you lower your head to contemplate how to broach the subject, the girl unexpectedly poses a question.",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE2_TEXT_4":"You raise your head, and what you see is a girl looking at you with a face expressing seriousness and curiosity in a peculiar way.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE2_TEXT_5":"\"I'm curious.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE2_STAGE3A":"\"Even as a mercenary, I'm not one to be rude\"",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE2_STAGE3C":"\"Why do you ask this?\"",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3A_TEXT_0":"\"It seems, Commander, that you are a person with certain principles.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3A_TEXT_1":"The girl seems quite satisfied with this response.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3A_TEXT_2":"\"Although almost all captains and fleet commanders in the sector are classified under the same identity, they are still different from each other.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3A_TEXT_3":"\"Obviously, fierce interstellar raider, guerrilla fleets rising against oppression, scavengers with twisted minds, illicit traders smuggling goods, can all be defined as pirates, but...\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3A_TEXT_4":"The girl's gaze gradually becomes determined.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3A_TEXT_5":"\"I hope, regardless of identity, one can uphold their own principles and beliefs.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3A_TEXT_6":"\"So, let's continue discussing matters related to joining the fleet.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3A_TEXT_7":"The girl, returning to her usual mode, smiles, indicating a return to negotiation matters. Confused and slightly shaken by the girl's declaration, you quickly return to reality upon hearing this.",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3B_TEXT_0":"\"Quite an interesting answer, Commander.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3B_TEXT_1":"Judging from the girl's expression, she seems somewhat pleased.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3B_TEXT_2":"\"Not a direct answer, but it provides a considerable amount of information. Although this kind of ambiguous response can sometimes lead to problems, it is undoubtedly a good answer.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3B_TEXT_3":"\"But also because of such an answer, if no one is interested in oneself, there is often a feeling of being forgotten or a need for recognition... Dealing with these quirky individuals can be quite troublesome.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3B_TEXT_4":"The girl half-jokingly complains, but the overall atmosphere still seems quite optimistic and friendly.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3B_TEXT_5":"\"Fortunately, recent experiences made me realize that there are always more peculiar beings in the world who are interested in those with strange ideas.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3B_TEXT_6":"\"So, let's discuss our common interests and consider Commander's proposal.\"",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3C_TEXT_0":"\"Answering a question with a question isn't a good habit, Commander.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3C_TEXT_1":"Accompanied by a familiar but somewhat different, relaxed yet half-serious laughter, the girl continues",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3C_TEXT_2":"\"Suddenly asking strange questions is one of my bad habits...\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3C_TEXT_3":"\"But even from the most pragmatic perspective, people would never want others to forget them...\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3C_TEXT_4":"The girl gazes at the stars.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3C_TEXT_5":"\"On a deeper level, people always wonder what kind of being they truly are, right?\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3C_TEXT_6":"\"I think this is something that can't be fully understood by oneself alone.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3C_TEXT_7":"You feel that the girl seems to enter a somewhat self-centered state, but just as this thought enters your mind, she redirects her gaze back to you, smiling.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3C_TEXT_8":"\"So, talk time ends here. Next, Commander, let's talk about your previous proposal?\"",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE3ABC_STAGE4":"\"In terms of the number of words, you are really different from those guys who can sign contracts with just a few words.\"",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE4_TEXT_0":"\"Of course, for me, being able to talk to interesting or trusted people is a rather hard-won treasure, you know?\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE4_TEXT_1":"The girl's response is quite intriguing, and you sense a strange attitude mixed with both negativity and positivity.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE4_TEXT_2":"\"I may not be human, but I'm very curious about the outside world and ordinary people. After all, sometimes, records in books or databases can't compare to real-life examples.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE4_TEXT_3":"Underneath the girl's slightly playful tone, you are a bit perplexed by the contrast that has been subtly emphasized.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE4_TEXT_4":"However, it seems to matter little. The girl's smile, observed after she gauges your reaction, and the still dream-like wings, delicately eliminate the temporary sense of otherness, quickly bringing you back to the normal rhythm.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE4_STAGE5":"\"If you're not human, then you must be a youkai, right?\"",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE5_TEXT_0":"\"Well, although conceptually so, saying it's a youkai, in this era, there are still tangible life forms, so they still get injured like humans. But in terms of physical qualities, compared to humans, there are still some advantages.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE5_TEXT_1":"The girl calmly explains her race to you, even though you didn't directly inquire about this information. However, she seems quite willing to share.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE5_TEXT_2":"\"In general, that's all the information. I told you for personal interest, just like that.\"",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE5_TEXT_3":"Following this unexpected excitement, the girl returns to her previous seriousness and a more familiar calm. You finally seize the opportunity to start negotiating the terms of her joining.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE5_TEXT_4":"Everything finally returns to normal.",
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE5_STAGE6":"Continue",

      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE6_TEXT_0":"Compared to the previous conversation, the normal negotiation goes unusually smoothly, and the results obtained even exceed your expectations. The girl readily agrees to a long-term contract, unlike those seasoned mercenaries who only allow short-term agreements.",  
      "FM_TokikoBarEventFinal_STAGE6_TEXT_1":"However, in response, as a condition, the contract terms ultimately include some minor requests based on the girl's personal interests, such as a small supply of traditional paper and fabric.",
