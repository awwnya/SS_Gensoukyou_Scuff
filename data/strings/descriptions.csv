FM_Rotation,SHIP,"A sort of beginning for the Gensoukyou Manufacture Fleet, the Kaiten class is equipped powerful energy system and weapon slots when compared to typical frigate. It integrates a wide range tactical support system based on technological application of spiritual energy, giving it the ability to take damage for other ships and making it a common sight in large-scale fleet engagement.

As an important early technological cooperation between the technology within the boundaries and outside, the Kaiten class appears to be a conservative design based on the expansion era assault design philosophy of a highly manueverable  ship equipped with energy weapon combined with the installation of spirtual energy technology from within the boundary as a modular tactical system. While the design seems simple its very versatile and partical. It largely mitigated the limited ability for Expansion Era designs to adjust to a large scale combat. Various type of testing and research on it have paved the groundwork for the subsequent engineering of more unique doctrines in Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet.

Notably, although its early prototype model were not fitted with Drone systems, under the influences by some important people within the inner side of boundaries has led to all variants of her class in current era to be fitted with auxiliary drones known as ""Kedama"". Nowadays its common to see this class with its drones in festival of all place instead of combats, dazzling the audience with excellent visual spectacle with Kedama excellent atmospheric manuevere and magnificient ""danmaku"" pattern.

The crew and captain of Kedama class often associated with dedication and self-sacrifice in popular fiction, perhaps following some of the legends and stories from the inner side of boundary.

FM_Firefly,SHIP,"A Multi-purpose frigate designed around its medium universal slot, its equipped with flux conduits and small auxiliary weaponries on par wtih expansion era frigate. Often seen in small skirmish due to its simple design easy maintenance, but at times also seen with missile to support and harras enemy in large engagement. Its relatively decent mobility and capability to deploy Active Decoys ensured its survivability.

The Hotaru class was initially a poorly thought of project that underwent several iterations. The project as commenced on the day of Gensoukyou Manufacture revealed themselves in the sector, and designed for low intensity security missions. The project was only saved from the cutting board at the protest of civilian Organization on the inner-side of The Boundaries. Althought the project's fund and technical support was fairly strained compared to typical project thats sponsored by Gensoukyou Manufacture, Thanks to a talented young engineer from the outside and his assistant (and later wife, rumoured to be non-human) from the inner side, the Project was finally completed after many trials and error, and there have been numerous related literary work has been made on this topic since then.

The exact technical details of it also confirm the authenticity of the aforementioned story, Combining the standard combat capability of an expansion era military frigate with logistic efficiency thats comparable to high-grade civillian frigates, and outfitting the ship with a less fancy but versitile active flare system allows the ship to perform quite well for its intended purposes. Its also capable enough to deliver enough firepower to punish those who underestimated this small bug of a ship through its excellent general purpose mount and nimble mobility, which is quite impressive when used in large numbers.

FM_Rabbit,SHIP,"Commonly used as the core of a small detachment, its equipped with standardized weapon and energy systems. The ship is light, fast, and powerful with capability to scatter light minefields, making it particularly effective on small to medium scale skirmish.

Designed after the re-appearances of Gensoukyou Manufacture, the design has been rushed through development as a emergency production vessal, by taking reference from several popular frigate from the outside. While retaining most quality of a conventional frigates such as small missiles, the Usagi class is in a sense the true inspiration for the current Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet doctrines. Relying on its versatility to strike provided by its shipsystem and armaments, the frigate is able to take its sustained firepower to a whole new level while maintaing the excellent mobility and decent shielding of expansion era vessals. 

Since the time of constant raid from luddic pathers, the Usagi class has always been active on the frontline. To the point that during early production runs, it is produced nearly as ubiquitously as civilian shuttles. However with the directive of a more diverse fleet. The role of Usagi is now being replaced by more specialized ships. There are still a large number of Usagi class that have gone into civilian usage , or reserved as second-line in roles like Training Ship, just like typical frigates ship in the sector ""old soldiers never die"".

FM_Parasol,SHIP,"An Expensive and Advanced armed freighter, the Karakasa prioritize mobility when fighting alone engagement and is fitted with relatively less common hybrid weaponries. its relatively high capability has already reached to that of standard military frigates. However due combined factor of its high cost and difficulty in acquisition, it has almost no market in the smuggling scenes.

Nevertheless there is still a place for this excessively-capable design, for surveyor who cannot afford a larger exploration ship, the Karakasa-class are their best caretaker. Thanks to its highly automated subsystem the ship can be easily be operated by small crew. With its sufficient fuel and cargo spaces and its aerodynamic design for atmospheric re-entry making it excellent for planetary exploration and surveillances. With its reasonable armament configuration and support drones, when its properly used are capable enough to repel small pirates forces that are looking for troubles in outskirt of sector, a truely all-purpose ship.

Due to its popularity in exploration organizations thats focuses on exploring the unknown, and making up stories. The Karakasa is illustrated as a Cute Young Girl in popular fiction. Despite seeming to incorporate a lot of the legends from the inner side of the boundaries such as tsukumogami, the outside world's passion for derivative work for this character countinues unhindered. However for some reason there was an urban legends circulating on comm network that suggest the girl is not a fictional character.

FM_Egret,SHIP,"A Fast Carrier with impressive mobility, placing significant emphasis on bomber strike while also posessing a certain degree long range support capability, but without a proper support the ship's weakness in ability to maintain suppression will become obvious. 

Representing the carrier strike doctrine in Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet doctrine, it tries to improve the conventional expansion era strategy of torpedo strike by placing it on an entirely new highly agile platform. Notably, its Advanced Shipsystem ""Solitary Egret"" can be combined with advanced bombers such as ""Amanojyaku"" it can deliver payload with great efficiency.

However, despite being widely used as the main striking force, the shipsystem also contributes to pilots survivability. The reputation and word of mouth about the Egret within the lower ranks however are far from the expected positive images, especially in fleets where a higher proportion of inner boundary crew members are present. There are widespread legends particularly suggesting that the ""Solitary Egret"" can influence luck and other superstitions. The internal affairs department has taken down and giving response on these matters multiple times to ""dispel the superstition"" but the result seems to have little effect, despite statistical data that indicate low casualty rates for this ship.

FM_Puppeteer,SHIP,"A Agile, fast, and elegant small carrier with two hangar bays equipped with maintenances facility as well an efficient shields. its capable enough to hold its line at any range while also able to surpress the enemy defensive capability.

Unlike the commonly seen carrier like Heron or Condor, the Margatroid class has a quite elegant streamlined appearance and embellished aerodynamic design. If one were to describe its appearance in human terms, perhaps only the word 'maiden' could perfectly express it all. Conversely, as a combat carrier, the Margatroid class is extremely efficient in its lethality, especially combined with its shipsystem thats use technology derived from the inner-side of boundaries it can interfere and disrupt targets PD weaponry, along with its Unique built-in ""Fairy Tales Book"" module, allow the ships fighter to shred targets at close range.

Although various signs of detrimentals effect indicate its being caused by the built-in module thats derived from the technology of boundary inner-side toward mentality of the pilots and even the ship commander, surprisingly there is still significant number of crew who are willing to board this type of ship. perhaps because of this, in popular fiction the Margatroid onboard sub-system AI is often potrayed as a young girl who has obsessive devotion to someone to the point of imposing mental disturabnces on them.

FM_Aya,SHIP,"A great example of small Gensoukyou Manufacture ship, combining excellent mobility with small amount of flexible weaponries and a squadron of drones coupled with its special Fuujin shipsystem to traverse through phase space in short period. Making it a formidable ship to engage all of type of enemy.

Engineered with miniature phase technology, some deviation and improvement from the standard expansion-era assault doctrine. The Literary class compromises considerably on armor and hull integrity to achieve high speed and mobility which is uncommon for an destroyer. In addition the Literary class relies on its drones that complement its sustained firepower, in accoradnce with Gensoukyou Manufacture's fleet doctrine. Unlike many expansion era ships that are often mocked as  ""glass cannons"" , the ship's flux cunduit and shield system are capable enough to allow the ship to survive against a stronger enemy. With its shipsystem that essentially guarantees escape route at any time, even less experienced captain can utilized the ship's potential to some degree.

The Literary class was also important to the formation of present Gensoukyou Manufacture's Fleet doctrine. Despite being designed before the re-appearance of Gensoukyou Sector within the sector, the ship's combat report on various engagement demonstrated the potential of the sustained suppressive firepower theory and ability to perform PD task without relying on a large number of small weaponries. Due to this important history and the shi['s relatively simple and clean image of this ship, The ship's silhouette often used as an unnofficial symbol for Gensoukyou Manufacture ships.

FM_Miko,SHIP,"One of the most precious mass-produced destroyers that can be found in the persean sector, the Miko, integrated with the spiritual framework, possesses weapon adaptability surpassing most Gensoukyou-built ships and maintains the faction's well-known high mobility. This atypical design allows it flourish in high-risk engagement. 

First developed as a project to improve the phase skimmer system to be based on spirtual energy within the boundary, its development was largely handled by the inner side of the boundaries after it nearly drove several engineer from outside insane. Despite initial distrust from the outer side, when its final design was completed, almost everyone was shocked by its astonishing performance, and voices of doubt and opposition dissipated.

Unlike the expansion-era ships that adopt cutting edge tech without regard to the quality of crew life, the Miko, although possessing an Bizarre internal structure like most ships engineered by the inner side of the boundaries , it allows most crew members to maintain a relatively normal mental state during operation. However, on the other hand, perhaps due to some mysterious effect of the spiritual framework, members of the Miko class often report witnessing a series of incredible events. The most famous of these is the rumored incident near Blazing Hell in the year 193, where a large asteroid expected to impact the surface and the prototype of the Miko class which was undergoing early testing at the time experienced a resonance phenomenon, causing the asteroid to deviate from the orbit and avoided the impact.

It is why all of its anti-ship configurations ends up quite radical, while the shipsystem, although conventional, always prove quite effective.

However, despite the the best efforts from outside world to install capable shields and flux conduits, due to the excessive budget spent by the inner side of the boundaries on armaments and exterior design, this ship is still prone to dying horribly after running out of missiles in battle.

FM_Konpaku,SHIP,"A light cruiser design with a relatively bulky size but high agility, featuring an impressive array of energy weapons, cute yet dangerous drones, and highly efficient conventional engines. It holds unique value in missions focused on hunting down small targets.

The Tamashi-class is a peculiar design created through brainstorming by several engineers within the inner side of the boundaries, who don't quite resemble humans, after studying and learning from multiple expansion era designs. The prototype was then fine-tuned by a few young technicians from the outside world. While it overall adheres to the Gensoukyou Manufacture's fleet doctrine of sustained firepower, its primary role still overlaps with conventional expansion era light cruisers: relying on a powerful flux system and maneuverability, coupled with versatile energy weapons, to suppress enemy light vessels. However, when comparing the two, the Tamashi-class's lack of burst damage becomes quite apparent. It often relies on its mobility and flux system for self-preservation when facing true heavy ships rather than being able to launch a counter-attack.

Perhaps due to frequently appearing in the public eye as the flagship of light fleets in resolving small-scale conflicts, the Tamashi, with its clean and simple appearance, enjoys considerable popularity among the general populace. As a result, the Tamashi often secures the top spot in some sketchy popularity polls on comm networks, and there are even rumors suggesting that the Tamashi is highly popular in activities within pirate and pathers.

FM_Satori,SHIP,"While often assigned to auxiliary and support tasks, the Neru-class is essentially a versatile cruiser, with a flexible weapon array that allows it to play a significant role in both small and large-scale engagement.

As one of the few large ships designed before the re-apperances of Gensoukyou Manufacture, the Neru-class is somewhat of a budgetary miracle. In a scenario where most funds were allocated to economic development and the design of small ships, a design team primarily composed of outsider researchers managed to achieve performance beyond expectations by deriving some of the excavated Domain-era technologies from within the boundaries, despite having somewhat insufficient funding. On the other hand, due to substantial support from individuals and civilian organizations within the boundaries, the development of the Neru-class's ship systems and built-in modules proceeded quite smoothly (although it did cause various degrees of temporary psychological damage to many outsiders participants along the way).

In the days following the re-apperances, the Neru-class has consistently been tasked with supporting light fleets in combating pirates and pathers. Perhaps due to the deterrent power of its ship systems, fear of the Neru-class has now become commonplace in the underworld.

FM_Yagokoro,SHIP,"Undoubtedly the flagship of the Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet, the Yagokoro-class is a flexible and efficient multipurpose capital ship However, to fully unleash its capabilities, it requires an exceptionally skilled commander.

Although, before the re-appearances of Gensoukyou Manufacture, most of the research and development funds were invested in the development of small ships, the Yagokoro-class, as an emergency plan upon re-exposure, still received sufficient resources to sustain a slow-paced development. It was under these conditions that a significant portion of the ship's structure had already been designed before the re-appearances. After the re-appearances and re-contact, the project naturally received the highest priority and was rapidly put into combat.

From a design perspective, the Yagokoro inherits to some extent the theory of concentrated application of large carriers and carrier-based fighters from the Expansion Era, while absorbing some typical battleship elements. This hybrid design, coupled with advanced support AI from within the barrier and an enormous wide-ranging displacement device known as the ""Endless Gallery"" makes the Yagokoro a top notch practical design. 

Just like the stories within the boundray suggest, the present-day Yagokoro, like their namesake, mainly undertakes tasks of defense and guarding important objectives. In popular fiction, the commander and AI assistant of the Yagokoro-class are often depicted as wise sages.

FM_Miracle,SHIP,"A typical Gensoukyou Manufacture ship renowned for its frontal firepower and sustained suppression capabilities, the Kiseki-class possesses a formidable resilience and diverse tactical applications that seem to defy its basic parameters, giving it abilities to almost create miracles.

The initial design of the Kiseki-class was nearly unrelated to the outside, as it was originally being steadily developed as a civilian cargo ship for a civilian organization within the boundaries. It was a modular transport vessel designed for rapid shipping tasks, intentionally excluding shields and relying solely on a special ships system called the ""Miracle of Winds"" for protection. However, with the occurrence of the re-appearances event, official authorities began searching for alternative designs, and due to the exceptional performance of the ""Miracle of Winds"" system, which replaced shields in the original design, the Kiseki project was swiftly militarized.

Thanks to the earlier modular design, the Kiseki-class could accommodate the most advanced flux systems and corresponding weapon arrays available at the time in Gensoukyou Manufacture. The remaining researchers from within the boundaries once again optimized its power system and outer hull. In the end, this ship, which defied common sense but exuded a unique sense of the mystical, joined the fleet of Gensoukyou Manufacture, continually creating new miracles.

To commemorate this miraculous development process, all Kiseki-class ships have the simplified emblem of the original civilian organization painted in specific locations.

FM_Byakuren,SHIP,"An intermediate ship between a battlecruiser and a battleship, the Byakuren-class possesses considerable sustained firepower and relatively good maneuverability for a capital ship, though it currently cannot be considered supercapital.

Representing the cutting-edge of conventional Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet doctrines, the Byakuren-class boasts ample sustained firepower and a relatively flexible equipment arrangement. Its compact hull structure relies primarily on efficient shields and its inherent maneuverability for defense. However, from a logistical perspective, the expensive and challenging-to-maintain Byakuren-class is clearly unsuitable for widespread construction. Not to mention, the Byakuren-class places significant demands on the quality of commanders and crew members. The combination of these factors makes this type of ship relatively rare in the Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet.

Nevertheless, regardless of these challenges, when the Byakuren-class charges through enemy lines with lightning speed and unleashes its firepower at close range, various oppositions become inconsequential. After all, everyone's sage has more important things to do.

FM_Nightbird,SHIP,"A high-speed electronic warfare vessel with a certain degree of interferences capability, the Yasuzume demonstrates considerable efficiency in supporting and assisting large capital ships and countering missiles. However, this doesn't mean it cannot participate in skirmish just like conventional ships.

The image of Yasuzume is almost entirely different from the originally envisioned design of a resilient electronic warfare vessel by the Gensoukyou Manufacture. Nevertheless, after numerous modifications and adjustments by the Yasuzume design team, It ultimately achieved the initial requirements in a different form. This was accomplished by significantly reducing conventional armor and extensively using low-cost composite materials, granting Yasuzume unparalleled speed and maneuverability. Multiple redundant systems and automated damage control allow the ship to carry out missions even after the ship has lost its armored protection. The central ECM system, serving as its core, can handle dangerous missiles from a relatively long distance. The resilience of the ship under such design conditions is remarkable.

On the other hand, rumors suggest that the Yasuzume project is accompanied by a peculiar romantic story. Unfortunately, due to the existence of confidentiality regulations and similar constraints, the specific plot details are left to the imagination of the reader.

However, despite such drastic modifications, the modern Kagerou-class remains simple and reliable, much like its early models. After all, in this region of space dominated by missiles, the best way to protect allies is to use more missiles to defeat the enemy first...

FM_Hearn,SHIP,"A highly unusual cruiser design, with its shipsystems and integrated modules significantly enhancing the operational efficiency of space superiority fighters, while also possessing sufficient firepower for direct engagement.

Although ostensibly designed as a cruiser-level solution for fleet anti-air and space control operations in Gensoukyou Manufacture's fleet doctrine, the Hearn-class more commonly serves in anti-ship combat missions during actual combat. The ship's jump system, adapted from the Miko-class's mystical skimmer system, allows it to effortlessly teleport most of its fighter intact directly to the vicinity of enemy ships, causing damage. The Hearn-class itself has direct firepower equivalent to a conventional destroyer with a relatively superior flux system, supporting it in both anti-air and anti-ship combat. All these factors together making the Hearn-class one of the most impressive ship in medium to small-scale engagements.

However, as a ship primarily developed by the inner side of the boundaries, the internal structure and ship systems of the Hearn-class remains characteristically perplexing. Although not surrounded by rumors of designs that disrupt the mental state of crew members like some other designs, statistical data suggests that, despite not causing any truly severe psychological damage to anyone so far, serving on the Hearn-class does heighten an individual's mental sensitivity.

Furthermore, evidence shows that this class of ship seems to be affected by a more complicated memetic corruption. and its nickname, ""Boundary Scholar"" aptly illustrates this point...",,,,

FM_Rumia,SHIP,"Representing the next generation of ships incorporating Spell Framework design, the Yuugure-class is somewhat rare due to  insufficient emphasis placed on phase ships by Gensoukyou Manufacture, and the lower production output of this new ship type.

While the design was initially guided by the policy of directly adapting the phase ship usage from the Expansion Era, Gensoukyou Manufacture's peculiar application of technology ultimately transformed the ship into something almost entirely different from mainstream phase ships.

As the first ship to integrate the Spell Framework, the Yuugure-class's shipsystems design is quite extraordinary. Thanks to the Spell Frame's ability to allow direct manipulation of spiritual energy and generating it, the comprehensive weapon system known as the Cross of Dark Majesty makes the ship an extremely rare ship with both balanced offensive  and defensive capabilities (though the massive amount of space taken by the weapon inevitably leads to a lack of conventional weaponry). This dual capability significantly enhances the ship's flexiblity, to some extent compensating for the major weakness of phase ships. However, this also contributes to the relatively higher maintenance costs and the peculiar maintenance difficulty, making it somewhat costlier to maintain compared to other phase ships of its class.

Technical collaboration with the Inner Side of the Boundaries has brought new tactical ideas and provided opportunities for further refinement and improvement of old theories. Although designed in the early stage of the development of Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet doctrine, the Reisen-class is undoubtedly the most perfect small craft under expansion era doctrines: the precise teleportation based on Mystical Skimmer solidified the doctrine of ""Surprise"" into the ship's very hull. Combined with the firepower configuration dominated by energy weapons and the usual high maneuverability, it must be acknowledged that the differences between the Reisen-class is more similar to a Conventional Expansion Era ships than some other Gensoukyou Manufacture designs.

However, on the other hand, from the repeatedly reinforced but still fragile armor and structure to the firepower that is not quite sufficient for head-on combat, the flaws of the old theory are also quite evident in the Reisen-class. Therefore, overall, mastering such a ship still requires more experience and courage.

The design and tactical application of defensive escort ships led to considerable debate and even physical clashes between supporters of the core design from the Gensoukyou Manufacture Cadets Academy and supporters of the expansion era design. Unable to convince each other due to both side's belief on practical experience, this dispute provided the Gensoukyou Manufacture fleet with a perfect opportunity, as they are in need of a new security ship. Subsequently, the two vibrant but small teams were somehow brought together in a bizarre manner to complete a new project. The result is this bizarre ship that looks like a shuttle but has unparalleled defensive capabilities.

Thanks to some clever tricks and successful confidentiality procedures, the fleet successfully led both sides to believe that they were the only ones being funded, gaining an advantage in the budget plan. Although, during the final system integration, the core era supporters responsible for the ship systems and the expansion era supporters responsible for the ship's body and shield system design discovered the true nature of this opportunistic gambit.

FM_IcicleFall,WEAPON,"This is a standard anti-ship pulse weapon capable of continuously projecting partially ionized energy beams with a relative high rate of fire. However, this ability also leads to the instability in the trajectory and even the body of the emitted beams themselves...

This renowned multi-purpose pulse weapon operates on fairly traditional principles: by using high-frequency pulse laser to destabilize the gaseous-state ammunition, which are then simply launched via an accelerator. However, due to the unconventional nature of the gas ammunition and pulse generator used, the internal components of the energy beam often begin to react with each other over time, leading to the disintegration and splitting of the projectiles. However, as the projectile can still reach, and even exceed, its maximum range and hit its target in actual combat, this peculiar combination actually gives this weapon more possible uses.",General,,,

At the same time, given useful features like high single shot damage and good flux efficiency, this weapon can be used to great effect even in the hands of fools.

In terms of launching its projectile, it uses a technology similar to railguns and gauss cannons by directly launching a physical warhead, with ballistic properties. However, on the other hand, in terms of damage, it mainly relies on the enormous energy shockwave generated by the specially manufactured projectiles upon impact with the target.

On this basis, a new particle acceleration system and capacitor design ensure the weapon's ability to fire at high intensity and high speed. At the same time, its flaws are also evident.

Without the precisely enginereed Dichromatic Lotus Butterfly System, its massive Spiritual Charge consumption would deplete a spirit vessel with a single shot within a single capcitor's firing cycle, limiting the weapon's use to being an integrated armament of Miko-class.

The predecessor of the modern Hinotama was a type of support drone. It was designed to simplify maintenance by removing shields, installing cheap engines, and thickening armor as alternatives protection, thus controlling costs.

However, the soaring cost arising out of the series of experiments and the engineering team's misguided experimental approach ultimately led to the failure of the development of this support fighter. In the spirit of fully utilizing resources, the failed support aircraft prototype eventually became a testing platform for another new tactical system.

This new system, incorporating time-dilation technology for enhanced maneuverability, was found to generate a series of bizarre physical phenomena along the trajectory of the drone, causing significant damage to surrounding entities.
